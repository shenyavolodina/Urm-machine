Memory initialization is wrong. In presentation(slide 8) it is stated 
that arguments of a program are being initialized staring from memory 
address (or cell) 1. Where is in URM machine emulator arguments are put 
in memory starting with cell 0. 
Exact line:

It should be changed to:
mem = list(args)
mem.insert(0, 0)
